Description: The program is designed to automate image capturing using the FLIR Boson
cameras in the IRCSP. The program will continuously perform image acquisition with FPA
temperatures and store them with the Operating System Timestamp at time of creation in
order to create a tracking system for each file created during the flight mission.

    Main function currently executes a print statement which shows files in the current working directory.
    Utilized for cross-reference to ensure HDF5 file exist in the same directory as python program.
    The function checks if the file name already exist and will increment the file naming count variable
    until the next available file name is found. Once the next available name is found, the program will
    continue to execute the image capture function and create a new HDF5 file with the next most available
    file name.
